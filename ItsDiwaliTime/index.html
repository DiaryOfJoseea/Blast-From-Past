		              <p>Happy Diwali, Jigishaa....hope you had a good time celebrating diwali in Newcastle. You deserved a break from all the work and from all the reading you have been doing. [That was me being nice, u toh dont deserve a break...*evil laughter* it should be me who deserves a break from all the hard work I have been doing. You know how difficult it is to fall asleep in afternoon after you have already slept for 12 hours in the night. You know how difficult it is to find something to do even after you do 20 different things in a day to keep yourself occupied and still have hours left.] You don't deserve a break, I do. <br><br><br><br>


			            Anyway here is a little something for you to smile upon:<br><br>
			            <br>  
			           	K: ur WTs tmrw..sleep early...so tht u rest enough...<br><br>
						OJ: haan be thats the plan… i dont compromise my sleep for anything… sleeping is a very integral part of ma vie.. and ukw i love the before sleeping and after mentally waking up but not physically waking up wala phase :D coz then all random thoughts come to your mind.. and its really funnnn :D. Its like your mind has become aware of the surrounding but you have no control over your body.
