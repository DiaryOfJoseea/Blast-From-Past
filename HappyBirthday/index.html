	              Hey! Happy Birthday Jigishaaaaa!!!!!Sorry for being late, I had soo much work. But here it is. Just like what you did for me for my birthday, I tried doing it for you. I couldn't think of anything at first. Anyway, this is just a small list of the things that you like and that I could think of while making this [I just had one hour to make it, sorry]. Even though we chat and talk everyday, it does not feel the same. I feel the loneliness, even though it has just been four days. I would have made your birthday special if you were still here, i would have tried atleast. Well, no point in saying have an amazing day, coz I am one day late. But I can say have an amazing time at durham.<br> 
	              I wish I could have been with you to celebrate your birthday, 
	              but then you would have got all senti[like you are being right now while reading this, probably]. XD

	            	Hey Now! It’s your birthday. I’m sorry if no one in uni has made it as special as people at home would. If they have, Im super happy for you. Fyi, I didn’t get anything as homely for my birthday. But, honestly don’t worry. It will get better. I promise. You are going to find people who will love you. Don’t forget that I love you, too [but not as much as i love kumansh]. Make a wish and make sure you follow up and make it happen!
