		            <p class="para">Hiiii babes, okay so today is someone's birthday who was instrumental in starting our friendship- YES! BT! lol... It is so true when FB says that the bond between two friends is the fastest when they hate the same person. Well in our case, it was how we hated his constant 'hair styling'. So irritating. Anyway, I wanted this message to be read on his birthday so that we never forget the start to this beautiful friendship  I still don't know how we randomly ended up in the bathroom exchanging our notes on how we stalked him :p LOL it was fun. Just some flashbacks to make us smile :)</p>
