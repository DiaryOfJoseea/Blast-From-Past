            Well! If you are reading this, great work on deciphering your first cipher! If I have not already told you this before, from now on you will have to solve a small puzzle before you get the message. If you don't, you won't get the message. I gave you the first one for free.<br> Also, if you have any doubts about the instructions, just ask. Btw, this is just the beginning! Aage aage dekh hota hai kya.. :D

            <p id="subtext">Ps! Omi has contributed too! I thought you might like it to get stuff from her too.
            <br><br>
            Ps! She did it not because you are her best friend. She did it because she loves me more than you, and she couldn't say no when I asked her. :P </p>
